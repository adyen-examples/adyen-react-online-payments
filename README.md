# Adyen [online payment](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments) integration demos

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/adyen-examples/adyen-react-online-payments?ref=main&dev_container_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json)

## Details

This repository showcases a PCI-compliant integration of the [Sessions Flow](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/build-your-integration/additional-use-cases/), the default integration that we recommend for merchants. Explore this simplified e-commerce demo to discover the code, libraries and configuration you need to enable various payment options in your checkout experience.

The demo leverages Adyen's API Library for Node.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-node-api-library) | [Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries#javascript)) on the server side.

## Requirements

Node.js 20+

## Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

This repository is configured to work seamlessly with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). Each example can be opened in its own Codespace with all dependencies pre-installed.

For detailed setup instructions, see the [GitHub Codespaces Instructions](https://github.com/adyen-examples/.github/blob/main/pages/codespaces-instructions.md).

### Prerequisites

Before running any example, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in your Codespace:

- `ADYEN_API_KEY` - Your Adyen API key
- `REACT_APP_ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY` - Your Adyen client key (with REACT_APP prefix for React)
- `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` - Your Adyen merchant account
- `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY` - Your Adyen HMAC key for webhook validation

### Setting Environment Variables

1. Open your Codespace
2. Go to the "Codespaces" tab in VS Code
3. Click on "Manage secrets and variables"
4. Add the required environment variables
5. Restart your Codespace

Alternatively, you can set them in the terminal:
```bash
export ADYEN_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export REACT_APP_ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY="your_client_key"
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT="your_merchant_account"
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY="your_hmac_key"
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-react-online-payments.git
```

2. Navigate to the root directory and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Create a `./.env` file with your [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key), [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication) - Remember to add `http://localhost:3000` as an origin for client key, and merchant account name (all credentials are in string format):

```
# server-side env variables
ADYEN_API_KEY="your_API_key_here"
ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT="your_merchant_account_here"
ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourNotificationSetupHMACkey

# client-side env variables: using REACT_APP prefix to be included in the REACT build 
REACT_APP_ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY="your_client_key_here"
```

2. Build & Start the server:

This will create a React production build and start the express server

```
npm run server
```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to select an integration type.

To try out integrations with test card numbers and payment method details, see [Test card numbers](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers).

**Note**

The demo supports cancellation and refunds, processing the incoming [Adyen webhook notifications](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks). Make sure webhooks are enabled and processed (see below).

# Webhooks

Webhooks deliver asynchronous notifications about the payment status and other events that are important to receive and process. 
You can find more information about webhooks in [this blog post](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/consuming-webhooks).

### Webhook setup

In the Customer Area under the `Developers â†’ Webhooks` section, [create](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/#set-up-webhooks-in-your-customer-area) a new `Standard webhook`.

A good practice is to set up basic authentication, copy the generated HMAC Key and set it as an environment variable. The application will use this to verify the [HMAC signatures](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures/).

Make sure the webhook is **enabled**, so it can receive notifications.

### Expose an endpoint

This demo provides a simple webhook implementation exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications` that shows you how to receive, validate and consume the webhook payload.

### Test your webhook

The following webhooks `events` should be enabled:
* **AUTHORISATION**


To make sure that the Adyen platform can reach your application, we have written a [Webhooks Testing Guide](https://github.com/adyen-examples/.github/blob/main/pages/webhooks-testing.md)
that explores several options on how you can easily achieve this (e.g. running on localhost or cloud).
